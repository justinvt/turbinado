Firstly, you'll need git (we'll assume you already have that) and darcs to run this.  It should be easy to get from the darcs homepage or macports.

At this point this wil NOT install turbinado.  It will just pull all of the necessary libs and then not do shit.  I encountered one broken repo and probably half of the cabal installs threw errors, I'm guessing dependency issues, so the rest isyet to come, once I figure out what the fuck I'm doing.  I haven't written a single line of Haskell in my life yet, so I apologize for being an idiot here.
